# fileChanges
This project was created to suit my needs as a marketing director and secretary for societies that use multiple accounts. Oftentimes, I have to download posters and files and upload them elsewhere on the internet. During this process, finding the files I have downloaded becomes very difficult. However, I have noticed that if I move my files from download to desktop, they show up on my recent page when uploading which means I save the time of searching for the file. However, moving files also takes time so I wrote code that automatically moves the files I download to my desktop. Afterwards, I was aware of the clutter that would occur on my desktop so I introduced a condition that if the file had existed longer than 24 hours, it would automatically be deleted.
